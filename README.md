# Website

To view the website, clone repository, navigate to ```./website``` and run:
```
python app.py
```

# Database

To create database navigate to Database/Create_database folder and first run 'create_ncaa2018_elite_eight_db.sql' file in mySQL. Next load labeled 'load'. 

###  Note: Order of loading matters. Load in the order below:
* load_regionTable.csv 
* load_positonsTable.csv
* load_tournament_roundTable.csv
* load_teamTable.csv
